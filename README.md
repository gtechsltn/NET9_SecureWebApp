* 6: Native AOT
* 5: OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0
* 4: OAuth (Open Authorization)
* 3: JWT (JSON Web Token)
* 2: API Key authorization
* 1: Basic Authentication

* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
✅ Best for: Applications with predefined user roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, User).
✅ RBAC assigns users to specific roles, granting access based on their assigned role. It’s simple to implement and widely used.
* Claims-Based Authorization
✅ Best for: Scenarios where access is based on user attributes (e.g., department, clearance level).
✅ Claims-based authorization allows defining user claims (key-value pairs) to control access dynamically.
✅ Claims are typically stored in JWT tokens or identity providers.
* Policy-Based Authorization
✅ Best for: Applications with complex access rules beyond roles and claims.
✅ Policies define rules using claims, roles, or custom logic.
* Attribute-Based Authorization (Custom Handlers)
✅ Best for: Advanced scenarios requiring custom authorization logic.
✅ This method uses custom attributes and handlers to control access dynamically.
