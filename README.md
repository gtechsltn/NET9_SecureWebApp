* 6: Native AOT
* 5: OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0
* 4: OAuth (Open Authorization)
* 3: JWT (JSON Web Token)
* 2: API Key authorization
* 1: Basic Authentication

* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
âœ… Best for: Applications with predefined user roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, User).
âœ… RBAC assigns users to specific roles, granting access based on their assigned role. Itâ€™s simple to implement and widely used.
* Claims-Based Authorization
âœ… Best for: Scenarios where access is based on user attributes (e.g., department, clearance level).
âœ… Claims-based authorization allows defining user claims (key-value pairs) to control access dynamically.
âœ… Claims are typically stored in JWT tokens or identity providers.
* Policy-Based Authorization
âœ… Best for: Applications with complex access rules beyond roles and claims.
âœ… Policies define rules using claims, roles, or custom logic.
* Attribute-Based Authorization (Custom Handlers)
âœ… Best for: Advanced scenarios requiring custom authorization logic.
âœ… This method uses custom attributes and handlers to control access dynamically.

# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in .NET Applications

## What is MFA?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security mechanism that requires users to provide two or more forms of verification before gaining access to an application. This significantly enhances security by reducing the risk of unauthorized access due to stolen passwords.

## Why Use MFA in .NET Applications?
ðŸ”¹ Protects against credential theft and phishing attacks.
ðŸ”¹ Strengthens access control by requiring multiple verification factors.
ðŸ”¹ Ensures compliance with security standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

## Common MFA Methods
âœ… Something You Know â€“ Password, PIN
âœ… Something You Have â€“ OTP (One-Time Password) via SMS, Email, Authenticator App
âœ… Something You Are â€“ Biometric verification (fingerprint, facial recognition)
